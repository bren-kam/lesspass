        <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>
          LessPass is a password manager that doesn't save any data. The site,
          the login and the master password are mashed together with encryption
          to create a secure password. It will always generate the same password
          as long as those 3 parameters don't change.

        <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>
          Your master password is the only thing you should keep in your head.
          The emoticons on the right let you verify if you typed in the right
          master password. You will have to wait a second or so before it shows
          the good emoticons. Otherwise it'd be possible for a shoulder-peeker
          to guess the password character-by-character instead of all at once,
          with the former being trivial and the later impossible.

          Sometimes sites have specific password rules. For instance, some banks
          only accept passwords made of digits. The application let you set
          parameters for the generated password. Use the counter if you want to
          change the generated password without changing your master password.

          LessPass by default doesn't save any data. But you can if you want use
          LessPass in a connected mode. This mode helps you to save password
          profile needed to regenerate some passwords. A passwordâ€™s profile is
          everything except the master password and the generated password.
          There is no critical information (a generated password encrypted for
          example) in the LessPass database.

        <Paragraph style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>
          The sign in form ask for your master password. We use your master
          password to create a LessPass generated password using a default
          password profile. The master password is never send on our servers. If
          you don't want to encrypt your passord, you can disable this option in
          the settings
